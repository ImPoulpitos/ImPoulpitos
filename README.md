# Hi there üëã

I'm **Poulpitos**, **Back-End & DevOps Engineer** since 2022.

My journey started in 2020 when I was creating discord bots and small side projects.
Today, my interests are more in the backstages... working on APIs, owning a dedicated and self-hosted infrastructure, etc...

I love exploring and testing daily-used applications to understand how they works.

## Projects that I'm working on üìÇ

### [**Sea of Thieves France**](https://sotfr.net)
In **December 2021**, I joined the Sea of Thieves France's community as a volunteer to provide tools and applications for our french playerbase! With more than **95k members**, it is the largest Sea of Thieves affiliated community. *(We even have our own in-game ship set!)*\
